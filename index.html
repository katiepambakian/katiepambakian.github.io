                        <small>2024 | Java</small>
                        <p>
                            The objective of this project was to finalize the development of the board game Scotland
                            Yard, serving as the capstone project for my first-year Java course. The task required the
                            application of various design patterns, including the observer and visitor patterns,
                            alongside object-oriented programming principles like inheritance and polymorphism. This
                            experience also enhanced my familiarity with the Marvin testing packages. Beyond simply
                            finishing the game's development, we were tasked with creating an artificial intelligence
                            capable of playing as Mr. X, a character in the game. To achieve this, we employed
                            Dijkstra's algorithms and a two-step lookahead mini-max algorithm, crafting an AI with
                            strategic depth.

                        <h2>ExamTime</h2>
                        <small>2022 | Java</small>
                        <p>This program was designed to create an exam timetable and assign teachers to invigilate the
                            exams. The main challenge lay in ensuring students did not have conflicting exams and that
                            teachers were not scheduled to invigilate more than one exam simultaneously or when they
                            were supposed to teach. To tackle these constraints, I utilized the open-source AI solver,
                            Optaplanner, and implemented the solution in Java. Additionally, I employed PostgreSQL for
                            the relational database to store detailed information about the students, teachers, and
                            timetables. For ease of use, I developed a graphical user interface, enhancing the overall
                            user experience.

                        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed working on this small project. I implemented a recursive technique with
                            backtracking to create a Sudoku solver. Users can input their Sudoku problems, and the
                            solver will complete the grid. There are many possibilities for expanding this project, such
                            as adding the functionality to generate new Sudoku problems.

                        <p>This project was one of my favorites to both create and use. I completed an online course
                            offered by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to build a basic buggy and gain knowledge about the
                            robot library in Python, as well as the Raspberry Pi. This led to the development of a robot
                            capable of tracking a black line on the floor and detecting and avoiding obstacles around
                            it. To enhance its accuracy, I later incorporated additional ultrasonic distance sensors
                            into the project.

                        <p>
                            I created this game as part of a 3D game development course in Unity on the Udemy learning
                            platform. The game's objective is to guide the rocket from the starting point to the finish
                            line and safely land it on the landing pad. It was a fascinating experience to develop, as I
                            had to carefully consider physics and player experience when designing the controls and
                            course.
