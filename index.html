                        <h2>Scotland Yard</h2>
                        <small>2024 | Java</small>
                        <p>
                            The concept of this project was to to complete the implemention for the board game scotland Yard.
                            This was the final project for my Java module in first year. It involved implementing design patterns
                            such as the observer design pattern, the vistor design pattern as well as object oriented techniques like inheritance and polymorphism.
                            This project also gave me a better understanding of of the marvin testing packages.
                            In addition to completing the implementation of the game we were challenged to design an AI
                            that could play as MrX (one of the pieces of the game). We used techniques such as dikstras algorithms and 
                            a mini max algorithm to create a two look ahead AI.

                        <h2>ExamTime</h2>
                        <small>2022 | Java</small>
                        <p>This project is my largest project to date and was implemented for my A level computer science project.
                            This program was an application that would firstly create an exam timetable and then assign teachers to 
                            invigulate the exams. The challenge with this problem is that students cannot take more than one exam at once 
                            and teachers cannot invigulate more than one exam at once or when they have a class to teach.
                            To help solve these constraints I used the open source AI solver Optaplanner.
                            I also implemented a relational database to store information about the students, teachers and timetables.
                            I used a graphical user interface to allow easy use of the program.

                        <p>This was a small project that was very fun to code up. I used a recursive technique with backtracking.
                            The user can enter their soduku problem and the solver will fill in the rest.
                            There was lots of scope to expand this project such as generating new problems etc.

                        <p>This was one of my faviourate projects to both make and use afterwards. I followed an online course run by 
                            the Raspberry Pi Foundataion to create the basic buggy and learn about the robot library in Python 
                            as well as the raspberry pi. This resulted in a robot that could follow a black line on the floor as well as detect and avoid obstacals around it.
                             I then expanded on the project by adding more ultrasonic distance sensors to the increase accurasy.

                        <p>
                            I developed this game as part of a course on 3D game development in Unity on the Udemy learning platform.
                             The concept for the game is to get the rocket from the start to finish of a course and land on the landing pad. 
                             This was interesting to develop as I had to take physics and player experience into account when developing the controls and course.
